    <h2>How Cardiac Rehabilitation Can Help Heal Your Heart</h2>

    <p> If you have a heart attack or other hart problem, cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is an important part of your recovery. Cardiac rehab can help prevent another, perhaps more serious, heart attack and can help you build heart-healthy habits. Learn more about who needs cardiac rehab and how it can help your recovery.

Nearly 800,000 people in the United States have a heart attack every year. About 1 in 4 of those people had already had a heart attack.1 Cardiac rehab not only can help a person recover from a heart problem, but it can also prevent another heart problem in the future.

What is cardiac rehab?
Cardiac rehab is an important program for anyone recovering from a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart problem that required surgery or medical care.

Cardiac rehab is a supervised program that includes:

Physical activity.
Education about healthy living, including healthy eating, taking medicine as prescribed, and ways to help you quit smoking.
Counseling to find ways to relieve stress and improve mental health.
A team of people may help you through cardiac rehab, including your health care team, exercise and nutrition specialists, physical therapists, and counselors or mental health professionals.</p>

    <h2>Advancements in Heart Surgery</h2>
    <h5>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR), Sep 2, 2019</h5>
    <div ><img src="https://www.physiciansweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/TAVR-Location-feature-1280x720.png" style="height:200px; width: 300px"></div>
    <p>Every day, advancements are being made in the field of heart surgery. Advanced technology is making surgery easier and safer, and recovery faster and less painful. Beaumont doctors are advancing the science of heart surgery with new and innovative techniques for minimally invasive procedures, leading edge technologies, and clinical trials that reduce recovery times and generally help make heart surgery less difficult for patients.

Open heart surgery used to be the only way to perform surgery on the heart, but with the help of technology, more and more conditions are being treated with minimally invasive heart procedures. Beaumont physicians were the first in the Midwest to complete several advanced heart procedures, and that spirit of innovation continues to thrive today. For example, Beaumont is a pioneer in less invasive techniques to perform valve replacement surgery. We were the first hospital in U.S. to replace an aortic valve with a catheter through a small incision in the leg.</p>
